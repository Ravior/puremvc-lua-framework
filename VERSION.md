-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0   Initial version of Lua native port on PureMVC.org. 
      Does not require or depend on any class emulation library.
      
      This port is an summation of three separate LUA native ports that were created around the same time. The goal was to use the very best implementation of each method in each 'class'.
      David Foley took the reigns of the project doing the integration, documentation, and testing and will carry on as the official project owner.
